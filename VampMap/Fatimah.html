    <title>Fatimah Muhammed</title>

<body class="center">
    <p class="Play">Sheriff of Atlanta, Fatimah is, technically, unemployed. Without a Prince, she is a servant to the changeable and fickle Auntie Bedelia, as well as any Camarilla high ranking enough and full of themselves enough to give her an order. One of the Banu Haqim, along with her brother, her commitment to punishing the wicked extends into nearly masochistic territory. Still, she cares about her subjects, and her strong hand keeps violence from breaking out without nessecitating as many executions as one might expect.</p>
