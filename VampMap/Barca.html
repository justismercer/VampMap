    <p class="Play">Baron of Atlanta, packleader of the local Gangrel and Iberian murder machine, Barca is a hard man to interview. Not for lack of trying. He is violent, prone to rages and never backs down from a fight. Does that make him a bad man? I don't think so. He keeps his Kindred in order, and will make peace when it is just. Most nights he can be found at one of the local dives in Decatur, although it's said he's got a stashhouse somewhere with enough heavy ordinance to take over a small country.</p>
