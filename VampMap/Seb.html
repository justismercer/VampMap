    <p class="Play">Your friend, Seb. Me. A hungarian Nosferatu who managed to avoid the worst of both the Omen War and the rise of the Third Reich. But just because I escaped both, do no think I forgave those who destroyed my people and my home. I consider myself a part of the Anarch Revolt, though I think should things come to a head here in Atlanta I'll most likely flee that conflict as well. So it goes.</p>
