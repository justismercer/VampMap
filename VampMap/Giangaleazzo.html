    <p class="Play">Beyond the Sabbat's doctrinal hatred of the Antediluvians, their foremost personal enemy must be the great Giangaleazzo of Milan. One of the founders of the Sabbat itself, in time Giangaleazzo grew tired of the Jyhad. Assembling a council of Sabbat elders one night in his palatial mansion, he brought forth the founding document of the Sabbat's creation, and lit it on fire. Then, he lit the Elders on fire, announcing his newfound position of distinction inside of the Camarilla. An expert on hunting his former followers, Giangaleazzo has come to Atlanta at Auntie's behest, and will most likely be staying until there is no more revelry and no more slaughter to be had.</p>
