    <title>Constantino Giovanni</title>
</head>
<body class="center">
    <p class="Play">The Clan of Death, the Giovanni are the newest Clan in the World of Darkness after their founder, Augustus, diablerized and slaughtered the Cappadocians during the 15th century. An extended biological family as well as Clan, the Giovanni remain independant, for neither the Camarilla nor the Anarchs have offered them enough to keep them from double-dealing. Constantino is no exception; a bloodthirsty, incestous Necromancer more concerened with material advancement then in the tenants of the Masquerade or the Sabbat's Jyhad.</p>
