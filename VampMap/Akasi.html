<body class="center">
    <p class="Play">Akasi is a good man. Like his sister, he is a member of the Banu Haqim, and a consummate lawman. His coterie kept South Atlanta held through the entirety of the war, making him the longest reigning Camarilla in the city. He and his sister also forced a white peace between the Anarchs and Camarilla that remains (barely) to this day. Don't mistake the twins for anything other than the hardest motherfuckers in the city, and I'm including Barca in that list.</p>
