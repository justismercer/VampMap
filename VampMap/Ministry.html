    <p class="Play">Operating in Atlanta under a shell corporation, the Clan formerly known as the Followers of Set are back to their old schemes in Suntrust Plaza. Preachers and sinners, hucksters and prophets, I'd rather deal with a hundred Malkavians then one of the Clan of Liars.Still, they have considerable reach, and seem fascinated with the mutable faiths that spring up along the Bible Belt. IT wouldn't surpise me to find they have their hands in the megachurch and corporate charity rackets that seem so popular these days.</p>
