    <p class="Play">Supay Santiago, curator of the High Museum and a three-millennia-old mummy. Courted by both sides of the upcoming conflict of Atlanta, Supay knows better than to trust the Children of Caine blindly- his vitae is life incarnate, and of incredible value to the Kindred. A thoroughly moral individual, if possessing some outdated views on the world, Supay might be the only truly trustworthy power in Atlanta... if you can meet his exceeding standards.</p>
