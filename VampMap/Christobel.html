    <p class="Play">Here there be monsters. Julius Sutphan, former Archbishop of the Atlanta Sabbat, is supposedly dead or being kept in a Second Inquisition blacksite. But he left behind the whole of his Black Hand; Lasombra, Tzimisce, Salubri, Ul-Shugi, all of them. Leaderless, rudderless and mostly clueless, the Sabbat are little more than a rat infestation. But a rat infestation becomes a plague overnight if not cared for. As for this Christobel figure, give him one in the neck for me if you find out he's responsible for the creations roaming my tunnels. </p>
