    <p class="Play">A mysterious figure stalks the marble walls of the Shri Swaminarayan temple here. Hindu mortals may not realize it, but they are protected by a fierce creature from the old world; one of the Raktasahdu. The Kindred of India do not believe as we do in the truth of Caine's embrace, and are hesitant to define their relationship to our kind. Be cautious.</p>
