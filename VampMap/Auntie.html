    <title>Aunt Bedelia</title>

<body class="center">
    <p class="Play">Auntie Bedelia is the closest the city of Atlanta has to a Camarilla Prince. A Malkavian of the sixth generation, she may also be the most powerful Elder in the city. Her act as a doddering old lady is more than an act: it is a carefully designed personality intended to assist her in goals of total control of the city. The sire of the former Prince, Hodge, the Camarilla would more than likely offer her Princedom should she ask. That she hasn't is indicative of a greater plan at play.</p>
